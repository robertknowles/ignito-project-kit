**New Features:**

- âœ… **Cash Flow Positive Marker**: Green vertical dashed line with ðŸ’š emoji when cashflow first turns positive
- âœ… **Passive Income Goal Line**: Amber dashed line at the income goal level ($50k default)
- âœ… **Goal Achievement Marker**: Amber vertical dashed line with ðŸ’° emoji when income goal is reached
- âœ… **End State Annotation**: White callout box showing final annual income
- âœ… **Color-coded Bars**: Green bars for positive cashflow, red bars for negative

## Visual Design

### Colors Used
| Element | Color | Hex Code | Purpose |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| Goal lines | Amber/Gold | #F59E0B | Highlights goals and achievements |
| Break-even line | Gray | #9CA3AF | Neutral reference point |
| Positive markers | Green | #10B981 | Positive milestones |
| Negative bars | Red | #EF4444 | Negative cashflow |
| Positive bars | Green | #10B981 | Positive cashflow |

### Typography
- **Font Size**: 10-12px depending on context
- **Font Weight**: 500-600 (medium to semi-bold)
- **Annotations**: White background with 95% opacity, 1px gray border, 4px border radius

### Emojis Used
- ðŸŽ¯ - Equity Goal Reached
- ðŸ’š - Cash Flow Positive
- ðŸ’° - Income Goal Reached

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Charts showed data but no context for goals
- Users had to mentally calculate when goals were reached
- No visual indication of key milestones
- End states not clearly displayed

### After
- **Instant Goal Visibility**: Users can immediately see their equity and income goals on the charts
- **Milestone Awareness**: Clear visual markers show when key milestones are hit
- **Progress Tracking**: Easy to see how far along they are toward goals
- **Story-Driven**: Charts now tell a story of progression from start to finish
- **End State Clarity**: Final values are prominently displayed for quick reference

## Technical Details

### Data Sources
- **Equity Goal**: `profile.equityGoal` from `InvestmentProfileContext` (default: $1M)
- **Cashflow Goal**: `profile.cashflowGoal` from `InvestmentProfileContext` (default: $50k/year)
- **Chart Data**: Generated by `useChartDataGenerator` hook

### Milestone Detection Logic

#### Portfolio Growth Chart
```typescript
// Find when equity goal is reached
const equityGoalReached = data.find(d => d.equity >= profile.equityGoal)
const equityGoalYear = equityGoalReached ? equityGoalReached.year : null
```

#### Cashflow Chart
```typescript
// Find when cashflow turns positive (first time)
const firstPositivePoint = data.find(d => d.cashflow > 0)
const cashflowPositiveYear = firstPositivePoint ? firstPositivePoint.year : null

// Find when passive income goal is reached
const incomeGoalReached = data.find(d => d.cashflow >= profile.cashflowGoal)
const incomeGoalYear = incomeGoalReached ? incomeGoalReached.year : null
```

## Chart Components Used

### Recharts Components
- **ReferenceLine**: Horizontal and vertical lines for goals and milestones
- **ReferenceDot**: Markers at goal achievement points
- **Label**: Custom SVG labels for annotations
- **Cell**: Individual bar coloring based on positive/negative values

### Custom Label Components
1. **EquityGoalLabel**: Displays equity goal amount on horizontal line
2. **GoalAchievedLabel**: Shows year when equity goal is reached
3. **EndStateLabel**: Displays final portfolio value and equity
4. **BreakEvenLabel**: Labels the zero line
5. **IncomeGoalLabel**: Displays income goal amount on horizontal line
6. **CashflowPositiveLabel**: Shows year when cashflow turns positive
7. **GoalAchievedLabel** (Cashflow): Shows year when income goal is reached
8. **EndStateLabel** (Cashflow): Displays final annual income

## Conditional Rendering

All milestone markers are conditionally rendered:
- Goals only show if the value is > 0
- Achievement markers only show if the goal is actually reached within the timeline
- End state annotations always show if there's data

## Responsive Design

Charts maintain responsiveness while accommodating annotations:
- Increased right margin to 100-120px for end state callouts
- Increased top margin to 30px for achievement labels above chart
- Labels use textAnchor="middle" for proper alignment
- SVG viewBox coordinates ensure proper positioning across different screen sizes

## Testing

âœ… Build successful with no TypeScript errors
âœ… No linter errors
âœ… All existing functionality preserved

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Interactive Tooltips**: Click on milestone markers to see detailed breakdown
2. **Customizable Goals**: Allow users to adjust goals directly from the chart
3. **Multiple Goals**: Support for stretch goals and minimum goals
4. **Animation**: Animate the appearance of milestone markers
5. **Export**: Include milestone markers in PDF exports

## Usage Example

The charts now automatically display milestones based on the user's investment profile:

```typescript
// In InvestmentProfileContext
profile: {
  equityGoal: 1000000,  // $1M equity goal
  cashflowGoal: 50000,  // $50k annual cashflow goal
  // ... other profile data
}
```

When the simulation calculates that equity reaches $1M in 2035, the chart will show:
- A dashed amber line at the $1M level
- A label "ðŸŽ¯ Equity Goal: $1.0M"
- An orange dot at the intersection point
- An annotation "ðŸŽ¯ Goal Reached: 2035"

## Notes

- The implementation uses standard Recharts components for maximum compatibility
- All colors follow the existing design system
- No external dependencies were added
- The feature is fully backward compatible with existing data
