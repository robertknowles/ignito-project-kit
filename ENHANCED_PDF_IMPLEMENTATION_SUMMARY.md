   detectGoalAchievement() // Track equity and income goal achievement
   ```

3. **Property Classification**
   ```typescript
   classifyPropertyRole() // Classify by yield/growth/price
   generatePropertyRoles() // Build full role table
   ```

4. **Narrative Generation**
   ```typescript
   generateStrategySummary() // Create plain language summary
   ```

5. **Formatting Utilities**
