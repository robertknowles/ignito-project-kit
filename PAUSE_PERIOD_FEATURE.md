# Pause Period Feature Implementation

## Overview

Added a "Pause Period" feature that allows users to insert strategic pauses in their investment timeline. During pause periods, no property purchases are attempted, but existing properties continue to grow in value and generate cashflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Property Selection Context (`src/contexts/PropertySelectionContext.tsx`)

**Added:**
- `PauseBlock` interface to represent pause periods
- State management for pause blocks with localStorage persistence
- Functions to add, remove, and update pause durations
- Functions: `addPause()`, `removePause()`, `updatePauseDuration()`, `getPauseCount()`

**Features:**
- Pause blocks are tracked separately from property selections
- Each pause has an `order` field to determine its position in the sequence
- Duration options: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 years
- Persists to localStorage per client

### 2. Strategy Builder UI (`src/components/StrategyBuilder.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Pause Period card in the Property Building Blocks section
- Visual styling: gray color scheme to distinguish from property blocks
- Duration selector dropdown (6 months to 3 years)
- +/- buttons to add/remove pause blocks
- Counter showing total pauses added

**UI Elements:**
```typescript
- Background: gray-50
- Border: gray-200
- Icon: ⏸️ emoji
- Controls: dropdown + increment/decrement buttons
```

### 3. Affordability Calculator (`src/hooks/useAffordabilityCalculator.ts`)

**Modified:**
- Updated `determineNextPurchasePeriod()` to accept `propertyIndex` parameter
- Added pause period detection logic
- Skips periods that fall within pause ranges
- Extends timeline calculation to account for pause durations

**Logic:**
```typescript
// For each property, calculate which pauses occur before it
// Skip periods during active pauses
// Extend max periods by total pause duration
```

**Key Features:**
- Pauses are inserted based on `order` field
- Each pause blocks purchase attempts for its duration
- Properties after a pause wait until pause ends
- Portfolio continues to grow during pauses

### 4. Investment Timeline (`src/components/InvestmentTimeline.tsx`)

**Added:**
- `PauseItem` component for displaying pause periods
- Logic to insert pause events into timeline
- Visual distinction for pause periods

**PauseItem Display:**
- Gray background and border
- ⏸️ pause icon
- Shows duration and period range
- Displays portfolio value and equity (maintained during pause)
- Status indicator: "Paused"

**Features:**
- Pauses appear chronologically in timeline
- Show period range (e.g., "2025 H1 - 2026 H1")
- Note that existing properties continue to grow
- Portfolio metrics reflect state at pause start

### 5. Type Definitions (`src/types/property.ts`)

**Note:** No changes needed to types as pause periods are handled by the calculator logic skipping purchase periods.

## How It Works

### Sequence Logic

1. **User adds properties and pauses:**
   - Properties: P1, P2, P3, P4
   - Pauses: Pause1 (order: 2), Pause2 (order: 4)

2. **Resulting sequence:**
   - P1, P2, [PAUSE1], P3, P4, [PAUSE2]

3. **Timeline calculation:**
   - P1 purchased in earliest affordable period
   - P2 purchased in next affordable period
   - PAUSE1 blocks purchases for its duration
   - P3 purchased after pause ends
   - P4 purchased in next affordable period
   - PAUSE2 blocks purchases for its duration

### Pause Period Behavior

**During a pause:**
- ✅ Properties continue to grow in value
- ✅ Rental income continues to be generated
- ✅ Equity accumulates
- ✅ Cashflow reinvestment continues
- ❌ No new property purchases attempted
- ❌ Purchase periods are skipped

**After a pause:**
- Portfolio has grown in value
- More equity available
- Accumulated cashflow available
- Next property purchase can proceed

## User Interface

### Property Building Blocks Section

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⏸️ Pause Period                     │
│ Strategic pause in acquisitions     │
│                                     │
│ Duration: [1 year ▼]    [-] 1 [+]  │
│                                     │
│ 1 pause added to timeline           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Investment Timeline Display

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏸️   │ Pause Period                    │
│       │ Duration: 1 year                │
│       │ Period: 2025 H2 - 2026 H2       │
│       │ No purchases during this period │
│       │ Portfolio Value: $450k          │
│       │ Total Equity: $120k             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Pause
- Add 2 properties
- Add 1 pause (1 year)
- Add 2 more properties
- **Expected:** 2025 H1 (P1), 2025 H2 (P2), 2026 [PAUSE], 2027 H1 (P3), 2027 H2 (P4)

### Scenario 2: Multiple Pauses
- Add 1 property
- Add 1 pause
- Add 1 property
- Add 1 pause
- **Expected:** Pauses respected in sequence

### Scenario 3: Portfolio Growth During Pause
- Verify properties purchased before pause still grow
- Verify cashflow accumulates during pause
- Verify equity available after pause

### Scenario 4: Remove Pause
- Click [-] button to remove most recent pause
- **Expected:** Timeline recalculates without pause

## Technical Notes

### Period Conversion
- System uses 6-month periods (H1, H2)
- Pause durations are converted to periods: `Math.ceil(duration * 2)`
- Example: 1.5 year pause = 3 periods

### Storage
- Pause blocks stored per client in localStorage
- Key: `pause_blocks_${clientId}`
- Format: Array of PauseBlock objects

### Performance
- Pause blocks added to useMemo dependencies
- Calculator recalculates when pauses change
- Efficient sequence processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Drag-and-drop reordering of properties and pauses
2. Visual timeline builder with pause insertion
3. Pause templates (e.g., "Maternity Leave", "Market Correction")
4. Analytics on pause impact vs. continuous investment
5. Pause recommendations based on market indicators

## Files Modified

1. `/src/contexts/PropertySelectionContext.tsx` - State management
2. `/src/components/StrategyBuilder.tsx` - UI controls
3. `/src/hooks/useAffordabilityCalculator.ts` - Purchase logic
4. `/src/components/InvestmentTimeline.tsx` - Display component

## Migration Notes

- No database migration required
- Existing users will have empty pause blocks array
- Backward compatible with existing property selections
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
