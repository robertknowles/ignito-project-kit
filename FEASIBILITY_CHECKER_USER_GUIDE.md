# Feasibility Checker - User Guide

## What is the Feasibility Checker?

The Feasibility Checker is your personal investment strategy assistant that automatically analyzes whether your goals are achievable and suggests concrete adjustments when they're not.

## Where to Find It

The Feasibility Checker appears **automatically at the bottom of the Investment Timeline** when it detects potential challenges with your strategy.

## How It Works

### Real-Time Analysis

The checker analyzes your strategy **instantly** as you make changes:

✅ Adjusting deposit pool  
✅ Changing borrowing capacity  
✅ Modifying timeline duration  
✅ Adding/removing properties  
✅ Updating base salary  
✅ Changing annual savings  

**No delays, no loading spinners** - feedback is immediate!

## Understanding the Warning Levels

### 🔵 Minor (Blue Box)

### 🟠 Moderate (Amber Box)
**What it means**: Your goals are ambitious and need some adjustments.
