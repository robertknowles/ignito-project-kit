## Color Psychology

| Color | Emotion | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 🟢 Green (#10B981) | Success, Positive | Positive cashflow, achieved milestones |
| 🔴 Red (#EF4444) | Warning, Negative | Negative cashflow periods |
| 🟡 Amber (#F59E0B) | Goal, Achievement | Goals and their achievement |
| ⚪ Gray (#9CA3AF) | Neutral | Reference lines (break-even) |

---

## Accessibility

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Most Important**: Goal lines and achievement markers (amber/gold)
2. **Important**: End state callouts (white boxes)
3. **Contextual**: Break-even and reference lines (gray)

### Text Legibility
- All text is 10-12px with semi-bold weight
- High contrast against backgrounds
- Emojis provide visual cues for color-blind users

### Information Density
- Not cluttered - only essential milestones shown
- Annotations positioned to avoid overlap
- Conditional rendering prevents information overload

---

## Edge Cases

### If Goals Are Not Reached

**Scenario**: User's strategy doesn't reach their goals within the timeline.

**What Happens**:
- Goal lines still show (to indicate the target)
- No achievement markers appear (no false positives)
- End state shows actual final values
- User can see the gap between goal and projection

**Example**:
```
Equity Goal: $2.0M (shown as dashed line)
Final Equity: $1.5M (shown in end state callout)
No "Goal Reached" marker appears
```

### If Goals Are Set to Zero

**Scenario**: User hasn't set specific goals yet.

**What Happens**:
- Goal lines don't render (conditional: `if (profile.equityGoal > 0)`)
- Break-even line always shows for cashflow
- Property markers and end states still display
- Charts remain useful for tracking progress
