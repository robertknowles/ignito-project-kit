## 🎨 Sample Content

### Strategy Narrative Example
> "We begin with a Houses (Regional focus) purchase to build a foundation. As equity grows, it's recycled into Units / Apartments, Duplexes that compound over time. By Year 15, your portfolio becomes self-funding — meeting both equity and cash flow goals."

### Milestone Examples
- 📈 **2027 H2** → Equity release enables next purchase
- 💚 **2030 H1** → Portfolio turns cash-flow positive
- 🎯 **2036 H1** → Consolidation phase begins

### Property Role Examples
- **Yield booster**: High income, stable growth (e.g., Granny Flats)
- **Growth driver**: Lower yield, high capital growth (e.g., Metro Houses)
- **Entry-level, lower risk**: Affordable starting point (e.g., Regional Units)
- **Long-term anchor**: Premium, portfolio stabilizer (e.g., Commercial)
